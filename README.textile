h2. Settings

If you want to change the settings of the editor, you can do this by editing the 'tiny_mce_settings.js' file in your /public/javascripts/extentions/tiny_mce folder.

The 'radiant_tags' plugin is used to protect the Radiant tags from being destroyed by the editor. It will not hide your <r:> tags, instead it will preserve it from being sanitazied.
